This modified tn5250j is based on version 8.0.0 Snapshot @ https://github.com/tn5250j/tn5250j/
There was a need for a slightly changed version to better interact with a calling program.

ConnectDialog: Dialog & connections scrollpane made resizable, checkbox added to connections panel to overwrite encryption setting, cancel & window closing event now properly shut down the JVM when no session exists.   
My5250: Code cleaned up, shutdown logic changed to avoid buffer overflow error when closing/reopening sessions.
Small changes in  Gui5250Frame, GlobalConfigure, EmulatorActionEvent, GUIViewInterface to make certain elements accessible from outside.

tn5250j08mod.zip contains the runnable jar file.

# TN5250J
A 5250 terminal emulator for the IBM i (AS/400) written in Java.

Documentation is available at: [tn5250j.github.io](https://tn5250j.github.io/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tn5250j/tn5250j.svg?branch=travis)](https://travis-ci.org/tn5250j/tn5250j)

## History

This project was created because there was no terminal emulator for Linux with features like continued edit fields, gui windows, cursor progression fields, etc.

It was then open sourced to give something back to all those hackers and code churners that work so hard to provide the Linux and Open Source communities with quality work and software.



## Hosting

The project was previous hosted at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tn5250j/). But since 2016 has been migrated to GitHub.
