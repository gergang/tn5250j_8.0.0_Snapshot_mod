# TN5250J
A 5250 terminal emulator for the IBM i (AS/400) written in Java.

Documentation is available at: [tn5250j.github.io](https://tn5250j.github.io/)

## History

This project was created because there was no terminal emulator for Linux with features like continued edit fields, gui windows, cursor progression fields, etc.

It was then open sourced to give something back to all those hackers and code churners that work so hard to provide the Linux and Open Source communities with quality work and software.



## Hosting

The project was previous hosted at [sourceforge.net](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tn5250j/). But since 2016 has been migrated to GitHub.
